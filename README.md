# PINN_laminar_flow Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solver for laminar flow. The solver is designed to predict the velocity field (u, v), pressure (p), and stress components in a fluid domain using a PINN approach.

## Introduction

The PINN is trained to solve the laminar flow equations, including the continuity equation, momentum equations, and stress-strain relations. The solver is implemented using TensorFlow and PyDOE.

## Code Structure

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `PINN_laminar_flow` class, which is initialized with domain information, neural network architecture, and training parameters. The solver uses collocation points and boundary conditions for training.

### Usage

1. **Initialization:**
    - Create an instance of `PINN_laminar_flow` with domain bounds, neural network layers, and other parameters.
    - Initialize neural network weights and biases.

2. **Training:**
    - Train the PINN using the `train` and `train_bfgs` methods. The solver utilizes collocation points and boundary conditions for training.
    - Save the trained model for future use.

3. **Prediction:**
    - Use the trained PINN to make predictions for velocity (u, v), pressure (p), and stress components.

4. **Visualization:**
    - Visualize the results by comparing with reference solutions or Fluent results using the `postProcess` and `preprocess` functions.
